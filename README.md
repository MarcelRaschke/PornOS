# Disclaimer
I'm sorry if you actually expect to find some p\*rn here. This is just the name
of my [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28operating_system%29)
which is created for educational reasons. So you won't find any p\*rn here...

# FAQ
## Why on earth did you name your kernel like that?
Well, because it's dumb and funny. Imagine a discussion between two people (`A`
and `B` are two different persons):

> A: Hey! I use Arch btw. as my daily driver, what's about you?
>
> B: Yeah, I'm using PornOS 24/7
